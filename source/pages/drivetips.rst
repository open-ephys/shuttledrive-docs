Drive Building Tips
*************************************************

- Place the guide tube array pretty low down in the ShuttleDrive; as low as you can, to prevent the shuttle tubes from having to bend too much to enter the guide tube array.

- When you're done putting the guide tube array in, lower the shuttles to where you want to measure from and check no shuttle tube is sticking out the bottom.

- To secure the guide tube array, surround it with enough layers of 'paper' lab tape to jam it into the ShuttleDrive body. If you've put too much tape, unroll if necessary until you can wedge it in. Epoxy in the bottom and the ShuttleDrive body hole to keep it in place.

- Once the guide tube array, and the shuttle tubes are in place, you can place a blob of vaseline on the top of the guide tube array. Melt the vaseline (e.g. with a cauterizer) and it will set inside the drive. This seals the drive from the outside and provides an extra layer of prevention of contact between brain and air.
