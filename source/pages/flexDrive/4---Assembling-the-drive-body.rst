Be careful to drill out the holes at the correct angle - with lower quality prints it is pretty easy to break through the inner wall of the drive body rim.

To speed up this step, solder a screw to a piece of metal to use as handle. (If you're using titanium screws, flattening the head a bit with a dremel and crimping the screw into a handle is probably easier than trying to attach it with solder.) Now clean the hole again with compressed air/water. <strong>If there is plastic dust left in the holes, it can seem like the screws fit well judging by the torque required to turn them, but they might not 'bite' the plastic correctly and might not properly lower or rise. </strong><strong style="line-height: 1.4285715;">Pay close attention to how much torque is required for turning the screws</strong>  - if you feel any significant resistance now there is a good chance the screws will break later on in the drive-building process. In most cases too much torque means that there is too much plastic dust left in the holes, and you may have to drill them out more. If a screw breaks, you can sometimes carefully remove it with pliers.</div><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" height="377" width="400" src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/spring_align.png" data-image-src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/spring_align.png" loading="lazy"></span>

Glue the spring to the drive body using epoxy both at the sides and around the bottom of the drive at the radial slot cutouts in the spring. Make sure the bottom and sides are making full contact to the drive body and let epoxy cure fully before bending the spring arms. Placing the spring arms under screws while the epoxy still has even minimal creep can detach the spring.</div><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" height="428" width="500" src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/align_array.png" data-image-src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/align_array.png" loading="lazy"></span>

For most applications the tubes should be parallel to the main axis of the drive, but deviations of up to 15deg. are possible if desired. Use only a small amount of epoxy, and make sure none drips too far into the drive body so that the guide tubes can fan out immediately once inside the drive body or else you will have a lot of trouble getting them into the perimeter slots without kinking the tubes.</div><div class="methodblock">Cut the guide tube assembly about 5mm from the drive bottom using a fresh razor blade. The length of the protruding guide tubes can be chosen to fit the experimental design: Longer lengths increase visibility during the implant surgery and are useful in order to leave space for head posts etc., but shorter lengths lower the center of gravity on the head. If longer lengths are desired, make sure that a coat of epoxy extends all the way to the bottom, keeping the guide tubes in alignment.</div><div class="methodblock"><br/>For lateral targets, it might make sense to cut the guide tube array at an angle corresponding to the angle of the skull at the site.</div><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" height="204" width="400" src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/drivebottom.png" data-image-src="http://open-ephys.github.io/flexDrive/imgs/drivebottom.png" loading="lazy"></span><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> </span></p>

Make sure to keep the tubes as straight as possible, you may need to redistribute the tubes before you glue them into their final placement. Hold guide tubes in place by sliding very short pieces of 26ga polyimide tube (also called 'stabilizer tube') down from the end of the guide tube and pressing them into the larger, upper slots of the drive body (the thicker stabilizer tube should rest on top of the smaller, lower slots).</div><div class="methodblock">Glue guide tubes into place with thin layer of epoxy.

                    <div class="methodblock"><br/><br/>Insert shuttle tubes into guide tubes so that they are inserted ~1mm at the most retracted position. This minimizes the length of  the shuttle tubes that is inside the guide tubes - if that length is too long, it increases friction. <strong>Keep in mind the spring arms are halfway through their range of motion so make sure to account for how much further the screws could be retracted.</strong> <strong>If the shuttle tubes are so long as to reach the 'bend' at the bottom of the guide tubes, this can cause problems if the sizing of the tubes is tight - avoid this if possible. If the shuttle tubes are too short they can be accidentally removed from the ends of the guide tubes later on. </strong>See the image below for a schematic of how this shorter shuttle tube can reduce the friction:<br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"></div>
