The assembly jig was designed to hold the shuttleDrive as you assemble the drive, and pin and gold-plate electrodes. You will need to attach the mating connector of your EIB to the plastic EIB holder of the jig with glue (epoxy, ideally j-b weld) or tape. Complementary connectors are avaiable from Digikey and similar suppliers.
